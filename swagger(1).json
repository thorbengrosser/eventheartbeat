    "description": "# Overview\n\nEventMobi's Unified API is a comprehensive offering of all of EventMobi's\npublic platform functionality.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns please reach out to\napi@eventmobi.com.\n\n---\n\n# Changelog\n## Version 4\n### Breaking changes from the UAPI version 3 are indicated below:\n#### 1. Custom Fields Changes\n* On new endpoint version, <field links> must be explicitly added and managed.\n* Custom fields' root attributes changes\n  * `edit_permissions` - replaced with `editable`\n  * `applied_to` - moved to field links\n  * `visibility` - moved to field links\n  * `required` - moved to field links\n\n#### 2.  x_nested_list_partial_updates Changes\nIntroduction of `x_nested_list_partial_updates` is a header which provides the behaviour added to the system which makes it easier to append or partially update nested entities without having to specify the entire set of nested entities or risk accidentally deleting them.\nValue of this header is `1` by default in UAPI v4, however, you can still pass it's value as `0` to achieve v3 behavior.  it off in the API calls to leverage v3 behavior.\nTo understand this behavior, let’s assume a parent entity currently has two children: child-1 and child-2.\nExample: PATCH request to update children\n```\n{\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"child-3\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n* UAPI v3:\nThis request would remove the existing children (`child-1`, `child-2`) and replace them with a new child (`child-3`).\n* UAPI v4:\nThe same request would append `child-3` to the existing children, keeping `child-1` and `child-2` intact.\n\nDeleting Children in UAPI v4\nTo remove existing children in v4, you must explicitly mark them as deleted:\n```\n{\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"child-1\",\n      \"deleted\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"child-2\",\n      \"deleted\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"child-3\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis request will delete `child-1` and `child-2` and add `child-3` to the parent’s children\n\n\n\n#### 3. Other Changes\n* GET an event\n  * Small fix in GET an event endpoint. It now doesn't return `configuration` attribute automatically. Instead, it accepts the `configuration` and `event_icon` as includes.\n\n###  Non-breaking changes\n  * Adds field_link_type and fields_without_link_type filters to fields, filtering fields when they have or do not have that specific field link\n  * Fix API docs inconsistencies between supported query, search and sort parameters, request payloads and responses.\n  * Introduction of `content_experience` in the session APIs. This allows us to set up the session content experiences we want through our public API.\n\n#### ✨ Introduction of `registration_status` in People API\n  * What is registration_status?\n   `registration_status` indicates an event person's registration state for an event (e.g., whether they are registered for the event or are within another state). It will not be a breaking change in anyway.\n   Available `registration_status`:\n   - `not_started`\n   - `invited`\n   - `declined`\n   - `registration_pending`\n   - `registered`\n   - `expired`\n  * GET People endpoints will automatically apply the `registration_status=registered` filter if no status is provided in query parameter.\n\n# API Keys\nTo access the API, you'll need an API Key. Each key is associated with\nan Organizer and has the same access rights as that person does within\nthe Organization the key was generated for. API Keys cannot be used\naccross multiple Organizations, even if the owner of the key exists in\nmultiple.\n\nAPI Keys can be generated and managed from Experience Manager. From the\nOrganizations drop-down on the top-left of the screen, select\nIntegrations. On the API Keys tab you will have the option to generate\na new key for an Organizer within your Organization. You can also disable,\ndelete, or regenerate existing keys.\n\nOnce you have your API Key, you can use it access endpoints for your\nOrganization or Events within your Organization. The key must be\nincluded in every request in the Authorization Header.\n\nExample:\n`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`\n\n\n# Versions and Accept header\nProviding the version number is mandatory when making calls to the API. Use\nthe Accept header to specify the version.\n\nExample:\n`Accept: application/vnd.eventmobi+json; version=3`\n\n# Request Limits\n\n### Rate Limits\nCurrently no hard rate limiting is in place, however excessive and inefficient use of the\nAPI will be monitored and may result in a warning or in extreme cases to the API key being\ndisabled or removed.\n\n### Request Limits\nThe request line should not exceed 8k characters, doing so will result in a\n`414 Request-URI Too Large` response. This situation is primarily applicable when\napplying a large number of csv values to filter by.\n\n# Custom formats and string restrictions\nSome common rules regarding character data processing include:\n* Generally each string in the input must not include any control\ncharacters except \\t, \\n, \\r.\n* In most cases HTML sanitization is not performed, it is the\nresponsibility of the client to make sure that the data is not\ninterpreted when it is not desired.\n\n**Custom formats**\n* `id-string` strings represent various IDs generated by EventMobi\nsystems. The specific format is not guarenteed and may be changed without warning.\nFor instance the format may be all numbers, or may be a UUID, but in all cases these\nids should be treated as strings. All IDs are guaranteed to contain no more\nthan 256 printable ASCII chars.\n* `printable-stripped-unicode-string` strings can contain unicode\ncharacters, the whitespace characters are stripped from the beginning and\nthe end of the string before further processing.\n* `external-id` strings represent a settable id, useful for mapping ids\nfrom an external system to EventMobi resources. Resources can be retrieved\nby their external_id, and in some cases data relationships can be\nestablished based on external_id.\n* `csv-string` string supports multiple values separated by a `,`.\n\n\n# Error reporting and handling\nError reporting is provided as a part of response envelope. There is an\narray in `errors` property which contains a list of objects describing\nerrors. Error object is explained in detail as a part of response\nschema for each endpoint. We follow a few principles in error reporting:\n* Error `code` is human- and machine-readable, snake-case string. Error\ncode is unique per error type. The client does not have to consult other\nparts of error response to get the type of the error.\n* Single error object can represent a generalized error, especially\nwhen the error is related to validation. In this case the error is\nrelated to single input element. The code can also represent a specific\nbusiness error when it makes sense.\n* The response HTTP status code is guaranteed to have non-`2xx` value if\nthere was an error handling the request. In that case, if the response\nContent Type is valid, error details are provided as described above.\nNote that there is a chance that the response comes directly from\nintermediate system (for example, load balancer), in which case it won't\ncontain proper Content Type header and response contents will be\ndifferent.\n* Error codes returned from application correspond to different HTTP\nstatus codes. `400` corresponds to any error which is related to the\nrequest itself (for example, validation error, or any business logic\nerror). We use `401` and `403` for authentication and authorization\nerrors. `404` is used only for not found URLs. `406` is used for content\nnegotiation. `500` represents any other error.\n\n\n# Field visibility based on authorization\nSome endpoints might accept/return some Properties depending on the\nauthorization of the caller - this Properties will have a\n**x-authorization** definition within its description.\n\nThe **x-authorization** defines what are the authorization required to\nread/write the given property. It can define a one or many authorizations,\nseparated by comma, eg: _x-authorization:_ `\"event_organizer\"`\n\nThe possible authorization levels are:\n* event_organizer: authenticated user is an event organizer for the related\nevent;\n* resource_owner: authenticated user is the explicit owner of the\nresource, such as an event attendee retrieving their own profile\n\n\n# Includes and Data relationships\nIncludes allow for optional nested relational data to be returned when\nreading resources. This can be useful to customize the resource\nrepresentation for a particular usecase. It is important not to abuse includes by\nincluding excessive amounts or unnecessary information. Such abuse may result in\na temporary or permanent ban on using EventMobi's API. Please be especially conscious of\nusing minimal includes when retriving large collections of entities.\n\nIncludes are identified with the **x-include** definition on its\ndescription, indicating which include value to use to retrieve it.\n\n\n# Pagination and Sorting\nMost endpoints that return lists of objects support pagination and sorting.\n\n### Pagination\n\nParameters:\n- `page`: Specifies the page index. Starts from 0.\n- `limit`: |\n  Specifies the maximum number of items per page (page size).\n  The maximum limit, unless stated otherwise, is 1000.\n\n### Sorting\nUnless otherwise stated by default results are sorted by `created_at`.\nSorting will be done in ascending order by default. To sort in descending\norder, a minus sign (-) should be added to the beginning of the sorting\nparameter. Example: `sort: '-name'`\n\nParameters:\n- `sort`: List of fields to sort the query by, separated by comma.\n\n### Response Metadata:\nWhen an endpoint returns paginated data, metadata will be returned\nwithin the response, containing the current page, returned record count\nand total record count.\n\n- `limit`: Limit of items per page.\n- `page`: Current page index.\n- `page_items_count`: Amount of items returned in current page.\n- `total_items_count`: Total amount of items in the query.\n- `sort`: Fields used to sort items.\n\n# Searching and Filtering\nSome endpoints support searching, or filtering by specific fields.\n\n### Searching\nEndpoints that support search will have a specific set of fields that are\nused for searching. The fields used for searching are documented per\nendpoint. Currently only non-fuzzy searches are supported.\n\nParameters:\n- `search`: Search term to use.\n\n### Filtering\nFilters are passed in, and documented as query parameters.\n\nUse a comma to pass in multiple filter values.\nExample: `?group_ids=id1,id2`. Records matching any of the values will be\nreturned.\n\n# Image Uploads\nMeta data for files is handled separately from the actual data stream.\nUse the images endpoints to create images in the system before referencing them in other requests.\n\nTo upload an image the following steps have to be taken:\n* POST Request to the images endpoint `/events/{event_id}/images`\n* The call returns a temporary upload URL specific to this image. Upload\n  your image to this URL using a PUT call. Make sure to include the\n  `Content-Type` header and set it to the same type specified in the image\n  metadata.\n* When the upload is complete you must finalize the image upload by making\n  a PATCH call to update the image through the image endpoint using the id\n  returned by the original POST request (for example /events/{event_id}/images/{image_id}).\n  The status field must be set to 'finalized' in the request body. If an\n  uploaded image is not finalized with 24 hours, it will be deleted.\n\nThe following is a sample block of code in python to create and upload an\nimage to an event, and then associate it to a newly created company.\n```\nimport requests\n\nIMG_URL = 'https://uapi.eventmobi.com/events/{event_id}/images'\nIMG_DETAIL_URL = 'https://uapi.eventmobi.com/events/{event_id}/images/{image_id}'\nCOMPANY_URL = 'https://uapi.eventmobi.com/events/{event_id}/companies'\n\nheaders = {\n    'Accept': \"application/vnd.eventmobi+json; version=3\",\n    'Authorization': \"Bearer {api_key}\",\n}\n\n# Read Local Image Bytes\nIMG_LOCATION = 'IMG_20191114_135203.jpg'\nwith open(IMG_LOCATION, 'rb') as f:\n    image_bytes = f.read()\n\n# Create Company Image Metadata in EventMobi\nimage_response = requests.post(\n    IMG_URL,\n    headers=headers,\n    json={\n        'name': 'mycompanyimage',\n        'mime_type': 'image/jpeg',\n        'length': len(image_bytes)\n    },\n).json()\nupload_url = image_response['data']['upload']['url']\nimage_id = image_response['data']['id']\n\n# Upload Image bytes to Upload URL\nupload_response = requests.put(\n    upload_url,\n    data=image_bytes,\n    headers={\n        'content-type': 'image/jpeg'\n    }\n)\nassert upload_response.status_code == 200\n\n# Finalize the Image in EventMobi\nimage_finalize_response = requests.patch(\n    url=IMG_DETAIL_URL.format(image_id=image_id),\n    headers=headers,\n    json={\n        'status': 'finalized'\n    }\n)\nassert image_finalize_response.status_code == 200\n\n# Create a Company with the image\ncompany_response = requests.post(\n    COMPANY_URL,\n    headers=headers,\n    json={\n        'name': 'SuperMegaCorp',\n        'image_id': image_id,\n    },\n).json()\n```\n\n# Image Resizing and Manipulation\nThe Image entities returned from the Image endpoint contain a URL to the image's file. The image that this URL represents can be the original one or it can be manipulated and transformed\naccording to querystring parameters. Also, when creating a new image, a predefined crop, based on coordinates, can be set to be used by the system before resizing.\n\n## Query String Parameters\n\nIf `scale_width` and `scale_height` are not defined, `fit_in`, `smart_crop` and `fill_color` will be ignored.\n\nIf `fit_in` is false, `fill_color` will be ignored.\nIf `fit_in` is true, `smart_crop` will be ignored.\n\n### user_crop\nDetermines if the image will be cropped using the user's predefined coordinates before resizing to scale dimensions. Default true.\n\n### scale_width and scale_height\nDefines the image's size when returned.\n\n### smart_crop\nDetermines if the image will be automatically cropped using smart face detection. Ignored if `fit_in` is true.\n\n### fit_in\nDefines the resizing strategy. It is turned on by default when scale_width and scale_height are defined.\n  * When it is turned off, the image will be auto-resized and auto-cropped to have the exact size defined by scale_width and scale_height, but it won't stretch.\n    * If the image is smaller than the requested size, it will be first scaled up so that the whole area defined by scale_width and scale_height is filled and then,\n    if its aspect ratio is different than the requested, it will be cropped from the center.\n    * If the image is bigger than the requested size, it will be first scaled down so that the whole area defined by scale_width and scale_height is filled and then,\n    if its aspect ratio is different than the requested, it will be cropped from the center.\n  * When it is turned on, the image will be resized to fit in the imaginary box defined by scale_height and scale_width without changing its aspect ratio.\n  If the image's aspect ratio is different than the requested, the 'fill_color' parameter can be used to determine a color to fill in the missing area on the\n  imaginary box defined by scale_height and scale_width size. If fill_color is not used the image will be returned with its original aspect ratio (one of the sides will be smaller than the requested size).\n\n### fill_color\nDefines the color that will be used to fill in any missing areas on a image resized with fit_in.\n\n## Examples\n\nThere are several different ways to manipulate an image when making a request to the images endpoint. These examples will hopefully make it easy to understand how they work.\n\n### Original Image 1\n\nFor the examples, we are going to consider that this image was created with predefined crop coordinates of top: 100px, left: 100px, width: 300px, height: 300px.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/original.jpeg\" alt=\"Original Image 1\"/>\n  <figcaption>Original image - size: 640 X 360</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### Original Image 2\n\nFor the examples, we are going to consider that this image was created with no user crop.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example_2.png\" alt=\"Original Image 2\"/>\n  <figcaption>Original image - size: 640 X 184</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### Retrieving the original image\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>(not present)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>(not present)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n![Original](https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/original.jpeg)\n\n![Original](https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example_2.png)\n\n### Retrieving with predefined crop\n\nThe image can be retrieved with the crop defined during creation. If no crop was specified, the original image will be returned.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>(not present)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>(not present)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example1_crop100x100x300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 with user crop\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - User Crop: top: 100px, left: 100px, width: 300px, height: 300px </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example_2.png\" alt=\"Original Image 2\"/>\n  <figcaption>Original size: 640 X 184 - no user crop, orginal size returned</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### Resizing the image\nAn image can be resized by specifying both `scale_width` and `scale_height`.\nOther parameters such as `fit_in`, `smart_crop` and `fill_color` can be used combined with `scale_width` and `scale_height` to determine how the image will be resized.\n\n### Resizing without fitting in\n\nWhen fit in is not enabled, the image will be resized so that one of its dimensions matches the requested size.\n\n#### Different aspect ratio than the original image\n\nIn this example, the image's height will be reduced from 360 to 300, making its width decrease from 640 to 533.\nHowever, 533 is still larger than the 300 pixels requested scale width, so the image will have its extremities cropped out, half of the excedent size will be taken from the left side, and half from the right side.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>300</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>300</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example1_300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 resized different aspect ratio\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - Scaled to 300 x 300 </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n#### Same aspect ratio as the original image\n\nWhen fit in is not enabled, if the requested dimensions have the same aspect ratio as the original image, the image will just be scaled up or down.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>800</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>450</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/image1_800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 resized same aspect ratio\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - Scaled to 800 x 450 </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n#### Face Detection\n\nFace detection will be used when the image is requested with `smart_crop` parameter set to true and `fit_in` set to false.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>200</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>200</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example2_200x200_smart.png\" alt=\"Example 1 resized with smart crop\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 184 - Scaled to 200 x 200 with smart crop </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### Resizing and fitting in\nWhen fit in is enabled, the image will be resized so that it fits inside the area defined by scale_width x scale_height. If the image's area is bigger than the requested area, it will be scaled down,\nhowever, if the image is smaller than the requested area, it won't be scaled up, as it is considered that it already fits in the requested area, `fit_in` makes the image keep its aspect ratio.\n\n`fill_color` can be used to fill in with a solid color any difference between the requested area and the image's area.\n\n\n#### Different aspect ratio than the original image\n\nIn this example, the image's width will be reduced from 640 to 300, making its height decrease from 360 to 169. The returned image's size will be 300 X 169.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>300</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>300</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>not present</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/image1_fit_in_300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 resized with fit in\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - Scaled to 300 x 300 with fit_in, resulting in 300 x 169, keeping the original aspect ratio</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n#### Using `fill_color`\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>300</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>300</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>#FFC0CB</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example1_fit_in_300x300_fill_color.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 resized with fit in and pink fill color\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - Scaled to 300 x 300 with fit_in and fill_color #FFC0CB, resulting in 300 x 169 with pink margins completing 300 x 300</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n#### Fit in doesn't scale up\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>700</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>400</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>#FFC0CB</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example1_fit_in_700x400_fill_color.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 resized with fit in and pink fill color\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - Scaled to 700 x 400 with fit_in and fill_color #FFC0CB, resulting in 640 X 360 with pink margins completing 700 x 400</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n### Cropping before resizing\n\nThe `user_crop` parameter determines if the image should be cropped using the predefined coordinates before being resized.\nWhen user crop is used, the cropping will be done as a first step before resizing, so the same resizing rules shown above will be applied to the image after it was cropped using the predefined coordinates.\n\nAnother option is the 'pre_crop' parameter, which receives four comma separated numeric values representing coordinates to the top left and bottom right points that define the area of the image that should be cropped.\nFor example, pre_crop=100,100,300,300 would mean that we want to crop the image from the point (100,100) to the point (300,300) in pixels. If 'pre_crop' is passed, user_crop will be ignored.\n\n#### Resizing with the same aspect ratio without fit in\n\nApply user crop on Example 1 and resize it to 400 X 400\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>400</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>400</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>ignored</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example1_crop100x100x300x300_and_resize400x400.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 with user crop and resize\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - User Crop: top: 100px, left: 100px, width: 300px, height: 300px - Scale Width: 400px - Scale Height: 400px </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nResizing with the same aspect ratio with fit in and fill color\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_width</td><td>400</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>scale_height</td><td>400</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>user_crop</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>smart_crop</td><td>false</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fit_in</td><td>true</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>fill_color</td><td>#FFC0CB</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://em-api-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image-endpoint-examples/example1_user_crop_fit_in_400x400_fill_color.jpeg\" alt=\"Example 1 with user crop, resize, fit in and fill color\"/>\n  <figcaption>Orginal size: 640 X 360 - User Crop: top: 100px, left: 100px, width: 300px, height: 300px - Scale Width: 400px - Scale Height: 400px - Fit in keeps size at 200 x 200 and Fill color adds the pink margins completing 400 x 400</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n# Using Webhooks\nWebhooks allow you to be notified by our system when changes are made to certain types of data. You register a webhook with a callback URL and resource type, for a specific event. When changes are made to data with that type in the event your callback URL will be called.\n\n### Currently supported resource types\n* `people`\n* `people_groups`\n* `companies`\n* `company_groups`\n* `sessions`\n* `tracks`\n* `session_roles`\n* `schedule` - Webhook triggers per person when one or more of their scheduled sessions is changed. The `resource_ids` in this context are people_ids who have had their schedule modified.\n\n> Note that For entities like company_groups or people_groups we do not trigger webhooks for all of the entities under those groups. Example: a change to a people group, that is assigned to 10 people, will only trigger one `people_groups` webhook and no `people` webhooks.\n\n### Payload\nWhen our system calls your callback URL the following payload will be provided:\n\n| Field                 | Description                                                                       |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| operation             | The operation that was done on the resources (\"create\", \"update\", or \"delete\")    |\n| resource_ids          | List of IDs for all of the resources that were created/modified or deleted        |\n| event_id              | Event ID                                                                          |\n| type                  | Resource type                                                                     |\n| change_request_origin | Value of `X-Request-Origin` header of the API call that triggered the data change |\n| change_datetime       | The datetime the change occured in UTC, formatted as an ISO formatted string      |\n\nAn Example payload may look like this:\n```\n{\n  \"operation\": \"update\",\n  \"resource_ids\": [\"c408e457-7ebe-4b06-abd8-69a7c4fd3225\", \"93fda6bf-319b-44ad-ad14-359549855497\"],\n  \"event_id\": 1234,\n  \"type\": \"people\"\n  \"change_request_origin\": \"integration_partner\",\n  \"change_datetime\": \"2020-02-18T19:56:11.305246+00:00\"\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Notes\nThe payload of a webhook may include one or many resource_ids (always in\na list), depending on how my resources were created, updated, or deleted\nby a change.\n\nThe system will generally group all changed resources of a given type changed\nby one operation into one webhook payload with multiple resource_ids, however\nif a large number of resources were changed at once this may be split into\nmultiple webhook payloads instead.\n\nFor the `update` operation, the webhook payload does not indicate which fields\nwere modified. It is up to the integrated system to resync the data it cares\nabout.\n\n### Preventing Circular Webhook Requests\nThere may be situations where you want to subscribe to webhooks for a\nresource type that your system also updates. In this scenario you need to\nbe cautious not to create an infinite loop of updates (Your system makes a\nchange to EventMobi, which fires a webhook back to your system, which sees\nthe change and triggers another sync to EventMobi, etc.).\n\nIt is advised in this situation to prevent EventMobi from sending you\nwebhooks triggered from your own changes. To do this, include the\n`X-Request-Origin` on each API request to EventMobi with a value unique to\nyour integration, such as your company name. Then when you create a webhook\nset the `request_origin` field to the same value as you use in the\n`X-Request-Origin` header. When these two values match, the webhook will\nnot send, preventing you from being notified of the changes you originated.\n\n### Errors\nFailed calls to webhooks are retried by our system at a later time. A call is\nconsidered to have failed if the response code is something other than 200, 201\nor 410. For the same call, each subsequent retry will be called with an increased\ndelay.\n\nIf the same call to a webhook fails on the fifth retry, the webhook will be\ndisabled. To re-enable the webhook, make a PATCH call to the webhooks endpoint\n(`/events/{event_id}/webhooks/{webhook_id}`) and set `enabled` to `true`.\n\nWhen the system receives a 410 (gone) status code the webhook will be deleted.\nThis can be used to automatically remove webhooks that are no longer needed.\n\n### Versioning\nWebhooks are versioned like the rest of the API in order to prevent breaking changes.\nA webhook will automatically be given the version of the API request used to create it.\nA webhook's trigger mechanism and payload will remain consistent for it's version.\nA webhooks version can be updated, or the webhook can be removed and recreated under a new\nversion when it's time to uprgade.\n\n### Managing webhooks\nTo create/register or delete webhooks please see the 'Webhooks' section for information on the specific endpoints.\n\n# Authentication\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->"
